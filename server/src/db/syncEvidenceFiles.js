Subject: Complaint regarding financial fraud of Rs. 8,50,000/- by Hardik Verma.

Respected Sir,
I, Rahul Sharma (Aadhar No: 4455-6677-8899), resident of Sector 15, Faridabad, wish to file a complaint against a person named Hardik Verma. On 15th August 2026, Hardik approached me with a fake investment scheme promising 50% returns in one week. 

Trusting him, I transferred Rs. 8,50,000/- from my HDFC Bank Account (A/C: 501002345678, IFSC: HDFC0001234) to his ICICI Bank Account (A/C: 000112233445). After receiving the funds, Hardik deleted his social media accounts and switched off his phone. 

I request you to register an FIR and take strict legal action against him.

Signature: Rahul Sharma

Report No: CF-2026-8891
Date: 29-08-2026
Prepared By: Cyber Crime Analysis Wing

CASE REFERENCE: FIR 112/2026 (State vs Hardik)

1. BANK ACCOUNT TRACING:
A subpoena was served to ICICI Bank regarding Account No: 000112233445 (held by Hardik Verma). Bank logs confirm a credit of Rs. 8,50,000/- on 15-08-2026 from HDFC Bank (Complainant Rahul Sharma). 
Finding: Within 2 hours of receipt, Rs. 8,00,000/- was transferred to a cryptocurrency exchange wallet (Binance Wallet ID: 0xAbC123F456) using a VPN masking as a Singapore IP.

2. DEVICE SEIZURE ANALYSIS:
During Police Remand on 29-08-2026, a Lenovo ThinkPad (Serial No: LN-9988-X2) was recovered from the accused's secondary residence in Delhi.
Finding: Forensic cloning of the hard drive revealed cryptocurrency trading software and browser history containing login credentials for the exact Binance Wallet ID mentioned above. 

CONCLUSION:
The digital footprint and financial chain directly link the accused's bank account and seized laptop to the routing of the defrauded funds.`,

BAIL APPLICATION U/S 437 Cr.P.C (Sec 480 BNSS)
Case: STATE VS HARDIK (CASE-1)
FIR NO: 112/2026

Most Respectfully Showeth:
1. That the applicant/accused, Hardik Verma, is a respectable citizen with deep roots in society and no prior criminal record.
2. That the applicant has been falsely implicated in the present case due to a business dispute with the complainant, Rahul Sharma. The transfer of Rs. 8,50,000/- was part of a legitimate civil business transaction, not a fraudulent investment scheme.
3. That the Police have already completed their 3-day custodial interrogation and recovered the laptop. No further custodial interrogation is required.
4. That the applicant is willing to furnish a reliable surety and abide by any conditions imposed by this Hon'ble Court.

Prayer:
It is respectfully prayed that the applicant/accused be enlarged on bail pending the conclusion of the trial.

REPLY TO BAIL APPLICATION
Case: STATE VS HARDIK (CASE-1)
FIR NO: 112/2026

Most Respectfully Showeth:
1. That the State strongly opposes the bail application filed by the accused, Hardik Verma.
2. The Cyber Forensics Report (CF-2026-8891) clearly establishes that the defrauded funds were immediately routed to a cryptocurrency wallet (0xAbC123F456) using a masked IP. This proves malicious intent and destroys the defense's argument of a "legitimate civil business transaction."
3. The accused is a flight risk. If released on bail, he holds the technical expertise to destroy digital evidence stored in cloud servers before the police can seize it.
4. The investigation is at a critical stage. We are still tracing the remaining Rs. 50,000/-.

Prayer:
The prosecution prays that the bail application be dismissed in the interest of justice.

Date of Judgment: 15-12-2026

The accused, Hardik Verma, stands charged under Sec 318(4) BNS and Sec 66D of IT Act for defrauding the complainant, Rahul Sharma, of Rs. 8,50,000/-.
